# 🧑‍⚕️ Skin Disease Detection using Swin Transformer

This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for **skin disease detection** using the **Swin Transformer**, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architecture.  
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based vision models for medical image analysis, achieving **83% accuracy** on a challenging subset of the **DermNet Skin Dataset**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Automatically classify skin diseases from dermatological images.  
- **Dataset:** DermNet Skin Dataset (unlabeled and imbalanced, requiring preprocessing).  
- **Model:** Swin Transformer (Tiny/Small variants from timm).  
- **Framework:** PyTorch.  

**Key Features:**
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).  
- End-to-end model training and evaluation.  
- Robust performance on a difficult real-world dataset.  
- Achieved **83% accuracy** on the test set.  

📈 Results Accuracy: ~83% on DermNet dataset (challenging subset without labels). Demonstrates strong generalization despite dataset difficulty. Highlights the potential of Swin Transformer for medical image classification tasks. 

🔮 Future Work Fine-tune on larger dermatology datasets with clear labels. Deploy as a web app for real-time classification.Explore ensemble methods for further performance gains.
